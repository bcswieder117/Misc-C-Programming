# Misc-C-Programming
This repository will be dedicated to learning the C Programming language. I will include basic programs, some LeetCode done in C, and will use it learn concepts such parallel programming and computer architecture.

With the LeetCode files, I will be developing a separate repository for these when I am confident of my skills. This is a learning repository, and not necessarily stating that I am perfect in those problems by any means. However, hopefully will teach me the concepts I was never taught in a formal academic course as I specialized in Mathematics and Foreign Languages in undergraduate at Tennessee Technological University.
